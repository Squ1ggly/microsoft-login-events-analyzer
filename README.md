# Microsoft Compliance Login Events Data Analysis Helper

This project is designed to help analyze Microsoft login events data extracted from the Compliance Center for data breach analysis. It processes thousands of login events and enriches them with location information based on IP addresses.

The project takes a JSON array of Microsoft login events as input and generates a CSV file as output. The output CSV file includes location data for each login event, allowing you to easily examine where users have logged in from. This can be useful for identifying suspicious activity or potential data breaches.
